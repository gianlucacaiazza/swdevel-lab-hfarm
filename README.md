**Project Name:** Moody Tunes 

**What does Moody Tunes do?** 

The call to action is selecting their current mood from the available ones into the search bar. We have five possible moods which are: Chill, workout, passion, party and random. Our software will then generate a music playlist accordingly by selecting them from a 30,000 database of songs. Each playlist has its own ranges of values over 7 features, danceability, energy, loudness, speechless, instrumentalness, valence and tempo.

Our goal was to allow everyone to find the correct song based on their mood. 


**We ask the user to:** 


**Dataset**

We selected one database, named spotify\_songs, from kaggle. As we needed a large pool of songs in order for our project to work we selected the database 30,000 Spotify Songs. The chosen CSV file is from Spotify API.
